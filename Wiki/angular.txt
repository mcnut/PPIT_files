Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop

===============================

Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular 2") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address all of the parts of the developer's workflow while building complex web applications. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

Differences between Angular and AngularJS

Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its main architectural concept
Angular has a simpler expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding
Mobile development – desktop development is much easier when mobile performance issues are handled first
Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules, producing a lighter, faster core
Modern browsers only – reducing the need for browser compatibility workarounds
Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:
Class-based Object Oriented Programming
Static Typing
Generics
TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript). Angular also includes the benefits of ES6:
Lambdas
Iterators
For/Of loops
Python-style generators
Reflection
Improved dependency injection – bindings make it possible for dependencies to be named
Dynamic loading
Asynchronous template compilation
Simpler Routing
Replacing controllers and $scope with components and directives – a component is a directive with a template
Reactive programming support using RxJS

Naming
Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2" by the team, but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework.

Version 2.0.0
Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22-23. September 2014. The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers. On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview. Angular 2 can be downloaded from the official website. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015, and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on September 14, 2016.

Version 4.0.0
On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0. The final version was released on March 23, 2017. Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.
