Embedded JavaScript (EJS) is a set of two open source libraries providing in-browser client side templates for web development and as a template system for node.js (including client-side template functionality). EJS uses <% %> or [% %] tags, executing any JavaScript within the tags. Adding an equals sign (<%= %>) causes the enclosed JavaScript to be evaluated, and the toString representation to be appended to the document.

The original client-side EJS has been subsumed into JavascriptMVC, official support is offered at their forum (the old google group is no longer active).
